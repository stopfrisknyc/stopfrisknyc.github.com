{"body":"An API to access the [New York Police Department (NYPD) Stop, Question, and Frisk Databases from 2003-2011](http://www.nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/analysis_and_planning/stop_question_and_frisk_report.shtml), which were previously only available in proprietary database formats. Data elements include searches, stops, frisks, and the use of force, as well as demographic information about the individuals stopped under the policy. \r\n\r\nCivil Rights and Criminal Justice are not included by the Washington Post Issue Engine API among \"the 18 most important issues of the election.\" Our data suggest that they should be. In the first three months of 2012, 203,500 New Yorkers were stopped by the police. 181,457 were totally innocent (89 percent); 108,097 were black (54 percent); 69,043 were Latino (33 percent); 18,387 were white (9 percent).\r\n\r\nThis project developed as part of the Washington Post, NPR, and Sunlight Foundation's Election Hackathon from October 6-7, 2012. It reflects the work of multiple individuals from many organizations across many hackathons.\r\n\r\n- [PDF Applied Hackathon](http://pdfapplied.challengepost.com/submissions/8242-stopping-the-frisking-crime-data), June 9-10, 2012 in New York City\r\n- [Civic Hackers and the NYCLU New York City DataDive](http://datakind.org/2011/11/york-civil-liberties-union/), November 2011\r\n\r\nContributors of the Stop and Frisk Data API\r\n\r\n- [Chris Herwig](http://github.com/hrwgc)\r\n- [Ethan Jucovi](http://github.com/ejucovy)\r\n- [Michael Snook](http://github.com/michaelsnook)\r\n- [Alex Barth](http://github.com/lxbarth)\r\n- Elaine Wooton\r\n- [Marjorie Roswell](http://www.margieroswell.com/)\r\n\r\nSample Fields (Of 112 fields):\r\n\r\n- Race\r\n- Location\r\n- Reason For Stop - Wearing Clothes Commonly Used in A Crime (Y/N)\r\n- Reason For Stop - Suspicious Bulge\r\n- Reason For Frisk - Inappropriate Attire For Season (Y/N)\r\n- Reason For Frisk - Furtive Movements\r\n\r\nSample Query:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttp://api.occupy-data.org/v1/haircolr/WH/age/41?results&html&results_per_page=100\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contents of [Data repository](https://github.com/stopfrisknyc/data/)\r\n\r\n1.
